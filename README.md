# Hue 0.1 (C++)

**18.03.2020**

&#43;  Converted to C++

**09.03.2020**

&#43;  Fixed player falling in Stages 2,3

&#43;  Decreased Stage 3 Speed Boost to playable value.

**07.03.2020**

&#43;  One HUD only (configurable on Pawn in Level).

&#43;  Pawn functionality better inherited and compartmentalized

&#43;  The warning for falling fixed. Now not using physics to simulate falling. 

&#43;  Removed and cleaned stuff

&#43;  One of things undone by the pushing and pulling was the map packaging from before.


**06.03.2020**

&#43; Now falling kills again. Though there is a warning in PIE. Needs refactoring.

&#43;  Stage 3 finish event not called. Whatever, not bothering with such minutiae for now. Got to get the underlying stuff to work and then will just have to scale the levels.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
